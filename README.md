### Models 

VADAR MODEL
* Achivements

This model looks at each words in a sentence and score them on the bases of its sentiment.

At the end we found out that there is a relation between the score that is given by customer and their sentiment.   

* Problem

As we all that human language depands alot on context either than just words but this model fail to  estabilish any relation with context of sentence.

Roberta Pretrained Model

* Use a model trained of large  corpus of data.
* Transformer model accounts for the words but also the context related to other words.
